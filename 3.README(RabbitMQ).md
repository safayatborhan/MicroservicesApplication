# MicroservicesApplication RabbitMQ

Go to docker hub and copy necessary command to run rabbit mq and rabbit mq dashboard.
- docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management (the first port number- 15672 is management port number and second one- 5672 is the port number of rabbitmq)

If you already have this docker image in your machine, just run : 
- docker run "image id"

Go to docker images
- docker images

You will find another image of rabbitmq created in your machine. Go to docker containers to see if rabbitmq container is running.
- docker ps

You will be able to go to rabbitmq dashboard using that management port number in localhost. Default username and password will be guest and guest.
- http://localhost:15672/

Docker-compose command: 

- Go to file explorer of docker-compose
- Open cmd
- Stop all running containers one by one : docker stop 1b (1b is first two character of container id)
- docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
- run docker ps. If everything goes well, you will be able to see all docker containers running now. 
- go to localhost: 8000 has catalog microservice running and 8001 will have basket microservice running. 

Exceptional case: 

Sometimes you can see that your docker file is not updated and all endpoints are not there. 
In that case, you need to stop the containers and update the docker compose. Make sure you use 

- docker ps -a (This will return all container that is running and not running).
- docker rm container_id (You might want to remove some containers that is not running)

Then you need to remove the image that is updated but still not updated in docker-compose. 

- docker rmi image_id

Then again run the previous command.
