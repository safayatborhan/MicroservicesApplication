# Ocelot API Gateway

*Gateway Routing Pattern*

This routes request to multiple services using a single endpoint. This is usefull when we want to expose multiple microservice in a single endpoint and routed to particular service based on request. 
Giving an endpoint to each microservice can be challenging. 


*API Gateway Pattern*

Provides single endpoint for certain group of microservices. Knows as BFF (BE for FE). 
This sits between the client application and microservices. It acts as reverese proxy from client to microservices. 
It can also provide authentication, ssl termination etc.
